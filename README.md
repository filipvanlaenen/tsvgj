# Typed Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) in Java (TSVGJ)

This project aims to provide a domain-specific language (DSL) to create SVG
(Scalable Vector Graphics) files in Java in an easy way, with all the advantages
of typing. Below is a short list of the features it intends to implement:

* Make it almost as easy to read and write SVG producing code in Java as it is
  to read and write an SVG file in a text editor
* Use the advantages of typing, such that the Java compiler can validate much
  of the SVG code
  * This brings also the advantages of code-completion on SVG producing code
* Coverage of the basic elements and concepts of SVG
  * It is not expected to it will be possible to cover all aspects of all
    elements and concepts of SVG
